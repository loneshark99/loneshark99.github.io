How to run a Flink Application in Kubernetes.

1) Install Minikube on your maachine.
2) Install Flink-Kubernetes Operator as a Custom Resource Definition.
3) Install lens Kubernetes explorer to view the different deployment and interact with the Kubernetes cluster.
4) Start the Kubernetes cluster.
5) Run the following command. This is a useful step. 

   When you run this command, it outputs environment variables that, when applied to your shell session, redirect Docker commands to use Minikube's internal Docker environment. This enables you to:

    a) Build Docker images directly inside the Minikube VM
    b) Use those images in your Kubernetes pods without pushing to an external registry
    c) Access the same Docker daemon that Kubernetes uses to run containers

  After running this command, any Docker commands you issue (like docker build or docker images) will interact with Minikube's Docker daemon instead of your local one.

    ```bash
      eval $(minikube docker-env)
    ```
6) Build the application using Maven.

  ```bash
    yash@YashDevBox ~/I/flink-app> mvn clean install
  ```
  
7) Build your docker image.
